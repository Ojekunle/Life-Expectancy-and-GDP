## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy across different countries. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we explore whether economic prosperity correlates with higher life expectancy.
It also uses predictive modeling to estimate future life expectancy based on GDP values.

### Key Features

### Key Features
- Python package for data cleaning and visualization.
